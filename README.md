## iOS Voice recording with visualisation

and record button animation like in Apple Voice Memos app

This is an example only. 

This Project is not ready for easy integration a lot of refactoring needed. But if you can not wait, just drop `Recorder` directory into your project, then look at the api usage example in `ViewController` and experiment.

Do not forget to add `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` into your **Info.plist**
